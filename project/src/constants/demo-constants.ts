  WELCOME_MESSAGE: `ü§ñ Chatbot Demo Notice

Hi! I'm the Valsoft Restaurant AI Chatbot (Demo Preview).

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a preview version. The chatbot is not yet implemented.

When Fully Implemented, I Will Help With:
‚Ä¢ Browsing our menu and prices
‚Ä¢ Finding dishes that match your dietary needs
‚Ä¢ Providing dish recommendations
‚Ä¢ Answering questions about ingredients
‚Ä¢ Helping with order customization

Current State:
‚Ä¢ Demo preview only
‚Ä¢ Responses not yet implemented
‚Ä¢ Static interface demonstration

Coming Soon:
‚Ä¢ Full GPT-4 powered conversations
‚Ä¢ Smart menu recommendations
‚Ä¢ Dietary preference handling
‚Ä¢ Order customization assistance
‚Ä¢ Real-time response generation

For now, you can browse our menu manually while we prepare the full AI experience! üçΩÔ∏è
